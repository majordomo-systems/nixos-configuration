Yes, you can create different Nix shell environments depending on the project you're working on. Each shell environment is defined by a shell.nix file or a default.nix file within the project's directory. This file specifies the packages and environment variables you want to include in that particular shell.

Creating a Nix Shell for Django and Django REST Framework
Create a Project Directory:
Start by creating a directory for your project:

bash
Copy code
mkdir django_project
cd django_project
Create the shell.nix File:
Inside this directory, create a shell.nix file with the following content:

nix
Copy code
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

pkgs.mkShell {
  name = "django-env";

  buildInputs = [
    pkgs.python3
    pkgs.python3Packages.django
    pkgs.python3Packages.djangorestframework
  ];

  shellHook = ''
    echo "Welcome to your Django development environment!"
  '';
}
This configuration sets up a Nix shell environment with Python 3, Django, and Django REST Framework installed.

Enter the Nix Shell:
To enter this shell environment, run the following command in your project directory:

bash
Copy code
nix-shell
This command will drop you into a shell with Django and Django REST Framework available.

Working in the Shell:
While in the shell, you can run any Django commands like django-admin startproject, and you have access to the Django REST Framework as well.

Exiting the Shell:
To exit the shell, simply type exit or press Ctrl+D.

Deleting or Modifying the Shell
Deleting the Shell: Thereâ€™s no need to explicitly delete a Nix shell. The environment is defined by the presence of the shell.nix file. If you want to remove the environment, just delete the shell.nix file:

bash
Copy code
rm shell.nix
Modifying the Shell: If you want to add or remove packages, simply edit the shell.nix file and modify the buildInputs list. After saving the changes, re-enter the shell using nix-shell to apply the new environment.

This way, you can have different shell.nix files for different projects, each tailored to the specific tools and packages needed for that project.

I'd like to keep all my shells in /etc/nixos/shells/ (for example /etc/nixos/shells/django/shell.nix) - is this ok?

Yes, you can absolutely keep all your shell configurations in a centralized directory like /etc/nixos/shells/. This allows you to organize and reuse your shell environments across multiple projects. However, there are a few considerations and steps to make this work smoothly:

Creating and Using Centralized Shells
Organize Your Shell Configurations:
Create the directory structure you want. For example:

bash
Copy code
sudo mkdir -p /etc/nixos/shells/django
Create the shell.nix File:
Create your shell.nix in the desired directory:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/nixos/shells/django/shell.nix
Add the following content:

nix
Copy code
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

pkgs.mkShell {
  name = "django-env";

  buildInputs = [
    pkgs.python3
    pkgs.python3Packages.django
    pkgs.python3Packages.djangorestframework
  ];

  shellHook = ''
    echo "Welcome to your centralized Django development environment!"
  '';
}
Accessing the Shell from Anywhere:
To use this centralized shell in any project, navigate to the directory where you want to work and start the shell using:

bash
Copy code
nix-shell /etc/nixos/shells/django/shell.nix
This will start the Django environment as defined in the /etc/nixos/shells/django/shell.nix file.

Considerations
Permissions: Ensure that the /etc/nixos/shells/ directory and its contents are readable by the user who will be running nix-shell. Typically, this would involve setting the correct permissions with chmod or using sudo when necessary.

Reusability: Storing your shells in a centralized location like this makes it easy to reuse configurations across different projects or by different users on the same system.

Convenience: To make it easier to work with these shells, you might consider creating a shell alias or script that navigates to the correct directory and launches nix-shell. For example, you could add the following to your .bashrc or .zshrc:

bash
Copy code
alias django-shell='nix-shell /etc/nixos/shells/django/shell.nix'
Then, you can simply type django-shell in any terminal to start the environment.

This approach is quite flexible and allows you to maintain a clean and organized NixOS setup.
